- check that argnames match with reality? (in renderer)

- should we deprecate class:: and just use title::?
  or do we need a way to mark the actual doc that it's a class ref and not a normal doc?
  we could use only title:: but add an isClass boolean to the SCDocument struct,
  which is set by the parser if the path starts with "Classes/".
  the parser could take basedir and path as separate args.

- replace node->children with a linked list (node->next and node->tail)
  instead of realloc'ing? same for text strings instead of using strmerge?

- private:: now counts as a subsection (like method:: and copymethod::)
  this means it is a section that can't have any text in it, meaning it needs
  to come after any section text.
  an alternative would be to use the syntax: class/instancemethods optprivate subsections
  but that would mean it *must* come right after the class/instancemethods section header.

- integrate with sclang and make a primitive that returns the document tree
    SCDocument:
      root
      title
      summary
      categories[]
      isClass
      related[]
      redirect

    where root is an SCDocNode:
      type
      text
      children[]


- make a new renderer also in C?
  integrated with sclang that can access the introspection data (classtree and methods).
  it could use the docnode tree directly from the parser instead of going through sclang objects

- or, let both parser and renderer be standalone.
  * introspection data could be provided by a machine-readable file written by sclang
    - class tree, their methods, the filenameSymbol for each class and method.
    
    C classname
        F filenameSymbol
        CM methodname
            F filenameSymbol
            A name defaultvalue
            A etc...
        XM
        IM methodname
            etc...
        XM
        C subclassname
            etc...
        XC
    XC
    
  but then we need also an output mode that generates sclang code for docmap construction.
  scdoc_parse --metadata <filename>
  it could then write this metadata on stdout..
  (  
     title: "the title",
     summary: "summary",
     categories: ["category1","category2",],
     related: ["path1","path2",],
     methods: ["meth1","meth2",],
     keywords: ["kw1","kw2",]
  )

- even make the whole scdoc thing in C?
  * find all helpsource files and render if newer than html target
  * copy any other files as is
  * write docmap.json and/or docmap.scd for sclang interface, needed by find-help-for-string, etc.

  * docmap is also needed internally by scdoc renderer:
  - document title for links
  - class summary for classtree::
  We could have a mode to only parse the header, and run this first to create the initial docmap.
  then when we parse all docs fully, the other metadata would be filled in (documented methods, keywords, etc)

  * it should be fast enough to render all updated files at startup
  * the process can run in background with .unixCmd, with an action to set helpAvailable=true

...
real plans:

1. make a Document struct and parse header data into this, on C side

2. parser primitive that returns a SCDocument tree with SCDocNode's
   it should take these arguments:
        basedir - the basedir, like SCDoc.helpSourceDir
        subpath - path to schelp file relative basedir
        mode    - 0: full, 1: partial, 2: metadata
        
        metadata mode means it only returns the header data:
            title, summary, categories, related, redirect
        and the nodes needed for metadata:
            method, cmethod, imethod, private, keyword, copymethod
        Use a SCDocMapEntry for this?
            
        note: the current implementation also adds undocumented methods when
        it's a class. we need to do this on the lang-side.

3. rewrite SCDoc, SCDocRenderer and SCDocParser to use this.
   special considerations in SCDocParser:
        merge, getMethodDoc, generateUndocumentedMethods, etc.

        (should any of these methods be implemented on C side?)

        note that we insert undocumented methods already in the document tree,
        while other introspection data is inserted at rendertime.

4. move inherit-mets from JS to renderer.
   then, do we really need the subclasses/superclasses in docmap.js?
   yes, maybe for method search results ("class A inherited by B, etc..")

5. If metadata parsing is fast enough, do it fully at each startup instead of caching it.
   yes, the whole SC helpsource tree takes 1.5 secs on my machine

6. note that some docs need updating even if src not-newer-than dest:
   - class changed (check mtime of Class.filenameSymbol?)
     then we need to store the old mtime's on disk..
   - metadata changed (for link:: titles)
     not sure what to do about that.. actually it must be solved by a dependency system.
     docs that links to other docs has those as dependencies.
   - class hier changed (for classtree:: tag)
     this means we need to know if a doc uses classtree::, could be marked in the metadata.
